# topk-extended-ec14
The code for the experimental section in my EC'14 paper with [Yuval Filmus](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~yuvalf/): Efficient Voting via The Top-k Elicitation Scheme: A Probabilistic Approach.

The code implements a number of experiments that test the efficacy of top-*k* for the elicitation of partial preference under several positional voting rules as well as Copeland's (non-positional) voting rule under the Mallows distribution as well as the special case of the impartial culture.
